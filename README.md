Guess The Number
================

Description of the exercise:
----------------------------


I ask you to create a simple number guessing game. The game randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100, then it challenges the player to guess it in 10 attempts maximum. On each turn, the player must be informed whether or not he has guessed the correct number - if this is not the case, the game tells him whether his estimate is too low or too high. The game must also remind the player of the numbers already offered. The game ends when the player guesses the mystery number, or if he has exhausted his 10 chances. At the end of the game, the player has the possibility to start a new game.
